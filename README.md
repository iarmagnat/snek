Snake using electron

It was made as part of a 1 week discovery project around electron during my formation.
To make it work, just copy the file, npm install and then run the main.js file (via npm I must warn. Other ways may work but I didn't test any.)
I forgot to delete the compressed linux version that's laying around in the root directory... Sorry about that.
